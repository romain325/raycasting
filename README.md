# RayCasting

> In order to learn raycasting, I decided to follow [this repo](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraycaster)  
> For every commit, I write down the different function prototypes and write them by myself and compare my implementation 

This project is for learning purpose, I want to learn some basic rendering algorithm and be a lil bit more efficient in C++
